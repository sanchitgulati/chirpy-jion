## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Rice

1. Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
2. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
3. Add the rinsed rice, salt, bay leaf, cloves, cardamoms, and cinnamon stick to the boiling water.
4. Cook the rice until it is 70% cooked (the grains should still be firm).
5. Drain the rice and set aside.

### Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables

1. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan over medium heat.
2. Add the diced carrots, green beans, potatoes, peas, and cauliflower to the pan.
3. Sauté the vegetables for 5-7 minutes until they are partially cooked.
4. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Step 3: Cook the Onion and Tomatoes

1. In the same pan, heat another 1 tbsp of oil over medium heat.
2. Add the thinly sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.
3. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.
4. Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 2 more minutes.

### Step 4: Add Spices and Yogurt

1. Add the cumin seeds, biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt to the pan.
2. Stir well to combine all the spices with the onion-tomato mixture.
3. Lower the heat and add the yogurt, mixing thoroughly.


### Step 5: Combine Vegetables and Spices

1. Add the partially cooked vegetables to the pan with the spice mixture.
2. Mix well to coat the vegetables with the spices and yogurt.
3. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are fully cooked but not mushy.

### Step 6: Layer the Biryani

1. In a large pot or a deep baking dish, spread a layer of the cooked rice.
2. Add a layer of the vegetable mixture on top of the rice.
3. Repeat the layers until all the rice and vegetable mixture are used up, finishing with a layer of rice.
4. Sprinkle chopped fresh coriander and mint leaves on top.
5. Cover the pot or dish with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil.
6. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, or bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 20-25 minutes.


Enjoy your delicious Veg Biryani!
